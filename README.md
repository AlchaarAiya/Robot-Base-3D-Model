# Robot-Base-3D-Model

The following project contains the 3D modeling for a robot base. The repository contains 3 STL files that will be assembled after printing the models. The first file contains the main body of the base, which has a cube holder, which will be used to store all the required circuitry, and a cylindrical holder, which will be used to hold the robot arm in place. The following STL file contains the cover for the circuitry box. The final STL file contains the model for the wheels of the base. A morphological analysis was performed before designing the models, which is shown below.
